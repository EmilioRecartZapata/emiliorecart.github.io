Hi! my name es Emilio Recart research assistant at the [Laboratorio de la Conciencia](https://sites.google.com/view/laboratoriodelaconciencia/p%C3%A1gina-principal)

I am finishing my specialization in Data Science and Data Applied to Behavioral Science and Psychology. My research interests focus on applying Machine Learning to EEG signals and analyzing complexity measures such as entropy to characterize and differentiate unconscious and/or conscious processes that influence decision making.

I graduated in 2021 (GE = 8.21). Since the same year, I have been working as a lecturer in Research Methodology at the University of Buenos Aires. Since 2022 I am teaching General Psychology 1 and 2 at Maimonides Universisty.
